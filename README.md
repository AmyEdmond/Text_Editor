# Text_Editor
![License:MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The goal for this challenge was to create a text editor that runs in the browser as well as offline if it is installed using the install button. It is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser.

The app has been deployed to Heroku:
